This weekend was full of fun and WIN!
We had an all-night hackfest on both Friday and Saturday nights at our local hackerspace, P-Space.
The event was the first of it's kind for us and was an open invitation for local hackers to come,
socialize and write code on Arduino (or whatever else) projects.
